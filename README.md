# moving-cube
A moving blue cube in C + winAPI

To move the cube use the arrow buttons

This code was supposed to be a RPG but I gave up on the idea because I wanted to create something else

I hope you find it useful (?)

When building, exclude from the build the next files: game, renderer, platform_common and utilities.
